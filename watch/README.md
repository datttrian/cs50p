# <a href="#watch-on-youtube" data-id="">Watch on YouTube</a>

It turns out that (most) YouTube videos can be embedded in other
websites, just like the above. For instance, if you visit
<https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0> on a laptop or desktop, click **Share**,
and then click **Embed**, you’ll see
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (the language in which web
pages are written) like the below, which you could then copy into your
own website’s source code, wherein
[`iframe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)
is an HTML “element,” and `src` is one of several HTML “attributes”
therein, the value of which, between quotes, is
`https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvFZjo5PgG0`.

``` highlight
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvFZjo5PgG0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Because some HTML attributes are optional, you could instead minimally
embed just the below.

``` highlight
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvFZjo5PgG0"></iframe>
```

Suppose that you’d like to extract the URLs of YouTube videos that are
embedded in pages (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvFZjo5PgG0`),
converting them back to shorter, shareable `youtu.be` URLs (e.g.,
`https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0`) where they can be watched on YouTube
itself.

In a file called `watch.py`, implement a function called `parse` that
expects a `str` of HTML as input, extracts any YouTube URL that’s the
value of a `src` attribute of an `iframe` element therein, and returns
its shorter, shareable `youtu.be` equivalent as a `str`. Expect that any
such URL will be in one of the formats below. Assume that the value of
`src` will be surrounded by double quotes. And assume that the input
will contain no more than one such URL. If the input does not contain
any such URL at all, return `None`.

-   <span class="fa-li"></span>`https://youtube.com/embed/xvFZjo5PgG0`
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>`https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvFZjo5PgG0`

Structure `watch.py` as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify `main`
and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import
any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use `re`
and/or `sys`.

``` highlight
import re
import sys


def main():
    print(parse(input("HTML: ")))


def parse(s):
    ...


...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Hints

-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Recall that the `re` module comes with
    quite a few functions, per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html),
    including `search`.
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Recall that regular expressions support
    quite a few special characters, per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax).
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Because backslashes in regular
    expressions could be mistaken for escape sequences (like `\n`), best
    to use [Python’s raw string notation for regular expression
    patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re). Just
    as format strings are prefixed with `f`, so are raw strings prefixed
    with `r`. For instance, instead of `"harvard\.edu"`, use
    `r"harvard\.edu"`.
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Note that `re.search`, if passed a
    pattern with “capturing groups” (i.e., parentheses), returns a
    “match object,” per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects),
    wherein matches are 1-indexed, which you can access individually
    with `group`, per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.group](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.group),
    or collectively with `groups`, per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.groups](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.groups).
-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Note that `*` and `+` are “greedy,”
    insofar as “they match as much text as possible,” per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax).
    Adding `?` immediately after either, a la `*?` or `+?`, “makes it
    perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few
    characters as possible will be matched.”

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir watch
```

to make a folder called `watch` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd watch
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `watch/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code watch.py
```

to make a file called `watch.py` where you’ll write your program.

<span id="how-to-test" data-id="" style="top: -58px;"></span>

## <a href="#how-to-test" data-id="">How to Test</a>

Here’s how to test your code manually:

-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Run your program with `python watch.py`.
    Ensure your program prompts you for HTML, then copy/paste the below:

    ``` highlight
    <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xvFZjo5PgG0"></iframe>
    ```

    Press enter and your program should output
    `https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0`. Notice how, though the `src`
    attribute is prefixed with `http://www.youtube.com/embed/`, the
    resulting link is prefixed with `https://youtu.be/`.

-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Run your program with `python watch.py`.
    Ensure your program prompts you for HTML, then copy/paste the below:

    ``` highlight
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvFZjo5PgG0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    ```

    Press enter and your program should still output
    `https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0`.

-   <span class="fa-li"></span>Run your program with `python watch.py`.
    Ensure your program prompts you for HTML, then copy/paste the below:

    ``` highlight
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python"></iframe>
    ```

    Press enter and your program should output `None`. Notice how the
    `src` attribute doesn’t point to a YouTube link!

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program
that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to
test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/watch
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.
